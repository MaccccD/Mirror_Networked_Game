  fullNarrativeText: "It was supposed to be just another dusty, overcast morning
    at St. Francis College. But within minutes, the ordinary turned into a nightmare.\n\n\r\nA
    deranged madman and his armed crew stormed the school, locking down the premises
    and gathering terrified students and teachers into a single room. His demand?
    R2 million or he detonates the bomb he planted deep inside the school.\r\nBut
    he made one fatal miscalculation...\n\n\r\nHe doesn\u2019t know that the school\u2019s
    financial team - whom he\u2019s locked away in a separate office - is made up
    of retired military bomb specialists, now living civilian lives behind spreadsheets
    and calculators. And even more unexpected: in the room with the students sits
    a sharp-witted young girl - the daughter of a veteran teacher \u2014 who once
    watched her military parent dismantle a practice bomb just for fun.\n\n\r\nThese
    two - the retired bomb tech posing as a financial clerk (Office Player), and
    the brave student (Bomb player) hiding in plain sight - are the school\u2019s
    only hope.\r\nWith earbuds disguised as school-approved accessories, the two
    silently sync up across rooms, racing against a ticking clock and under the watchful
    eyes of armed maniacs.\n\n\r\nYour mission is clear. Work together. Stay hidden.
    Outsmart the enemy. Defuse the bomb.\r\nWill this be the last bell St. Francis
    ever hears?\r\n\r\n"
